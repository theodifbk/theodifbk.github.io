description: SET Distribuzione SPA manages almost all the electrical network over the Trentino territory. It uses around 180 primary distribution lines (medium voltage lines) to bring energy from the national grid and distribute it among Trentino users. The dataset supplies information regarding the current flowing through the distribution lines and details about how the distribution lines are spread over the Trentino territory.<br/> There is no spatial aggregation for this dataset. The current flowing through the distribution lines has been recorded every 10 minutes.
