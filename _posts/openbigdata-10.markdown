The dataset provides information on vehicles going through Milan as detected by inductive-loops that are spread throughout the area of the city. Data has been collected from 01/11/2013 to 11/12/2013.
The inductive-loop detectors are sensors and are part of a traffic monitoring system in Milan that records data every time a vehicle passes over the sensor. These data have been aggregated over time intervals of 5 minutes and provide information on the number of transits made by vehicles that passed through and the average recorded speed within each interval.
Temporal Aggregation: 5 minutes.
The dataset consists of two sub-datasets:
- Traffic Flow Dataset: provides information on the flow of the vehicles.
- Inductive Loop Detectors Dataset: provides meta-information on the sensors.
