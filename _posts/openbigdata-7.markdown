The dataset describes the pollution type and intensity of Milan city using various types of sensors located within the city limits.
This dataset provides information about the pollution intensity and type for Milan city. This information is directly provided by ARPA (Agenzia Regionale per la Protezione dell’Ambiente) at the following website.
The type and the intensity of the pollution are continuously measured by different sensors located within the city limits. Each sensor has a unique ID, a type and a location. Different sensors can share the same location.
The sensor can measure different type of pollution agent:
- Ammonia
- Nitrogen Dioxide
- Total Nitrogen 
- Particulate Matter <2,5 µm (PM2.5)
- Particulate Matter <10 µm (PM10) (SM2005)
- Benzene
- Sulphur Dioxide
- BlackCarbon
- Carbon Monoxide
- Ozone

The dataset is composed by two sub-datasets:
Data legend: it contains information about the sensors collecting the data: 
- ID, location and type of the sensor;
- measurement unit; 
- temporal aggregation of the measurements (which can be 1 hour or 1 day).

Pollution: it contains the measurements.
