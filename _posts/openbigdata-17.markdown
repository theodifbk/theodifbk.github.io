The dataset describes precipitation intensity over the province of Trento.
This dataset provides information about precipitation intensity over the province of Trento.
It consists of two sub-datasets:
- Data availability
the collection of precipitation data is not continuous due to technical issues (e.g. snow over the sensor radar). This set provides information on whether data has been collected or not for a specific time interval.
	Spatial Aggregation
	each record refers to the whole Trento province; higher spatial granularity is not required given that the availability of the data is not location specific. Either they are available for the whole territory or they are completely missing.
	Temporal Aggregation
	10 minutes
- Precipitation: this information is derived from the images provided by Meteotrentino at the following websites.
the spatial aggregation is the Trentino GRID squares.
The temporal values are provided every ten minutes.
