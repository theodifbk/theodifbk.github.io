The dataset describes various meteorological phenomena type and intensity of Milan city using sensors located within the city limits.
This dataset provides information about meteorological phenomena intensity and type for Milan city. This information is directly provided by ARPA (Agenzia Regionale per la Protezione dell’Ambiente) at the following website.
The type and the intensity of the phenomena are continuously measured by different sensors located within the city limit. Each sensor has a unique ID, a type and a location. Different sensors can share the same location.
The sensors can measure different meteorological phenomena:
- Wind Direction
- Wind Speed
- Temperature
- Relative Umidity
- Precipitation
- Global Radiation
- Atmosferic Pressure
- Net Radiation
The dataset is composed by two sub-datasets:
Data legend
