This dataset provides information about the telecommunication activity over the Province of Trento.
The dataset is the result of a computation over the Call Detail Records (CDRs) generated by the Telecom Italia cellular network over the city of Milano. CDRs log the user activity for billing purposes and network management. There are many types of CDRs, for the generation of this dataset we considered those related to the following activities:
Received SMS
	a CDR is generated each time a user receives an SMS
Sent SMS
	a CDR is generated each time a user sends an SMS
Incoming Call
	a CDR is generated each time a user receives a call
Outgoing Calls
	CDR is generated each time a user issues a call
Internet
	a CDR is generate each time
	a user starts an internet connection
	a user ends an internet connection
	during the same connection one of the following limits is reached:â€‹
	15 minutes from the last generated CDR
	5 MB from the last generated CDR
By aggregating the aforementioned records it was created this dataset that provides SMSs, calls and Internet traffic activity. It measures the level of interaction of the users with the mobile phone network; for example the higher is the number of SMS sent by the users, the higher is the activity of the sent SMS. Measurements of call and SMS activity have the same scale (therefore are comparable); those referring to Internet traffic do not. 
The spatial aggregation values are provided for the squares of the Tretino GRID.
The temporal values are aggregated in timeslots of ten minutes
