The ODI FBK - Open Data Institute Trento Node
====================

The FBK-ICT research center is since October 2013 the first Italian node of the Open Data Institute (ODI). Starting from January 2014, thanks to the active participation in the international open data community (Open Knowledge) and research network (The Governance Lab at NYU), FBK has established a brand new unit, DCL - The Digital Commons Lab, which officially delivers projects as the ODI Trento. Our node is an action-oriented lab, a catalyst for the open data culture in Italy. Researchers in DCL are interested in working on the quality and integration of crowdsourced data, building tools and enhancing data accuracy and reliability; analyzing the impact of the reuse of open data and collaborating with public administration to improve the process of opening up public data sets.  Current activities include the promotion of the use of OpenStreetMap in order to raise citizens’ awareness and participatory planning (for example in case of emergencies);  running training sessions, focused on open data reuse and digital storytelling, to stimulate the demand and conversation around data involving NGOs, local companies and local government institutions. The lab’s members are actively working on a EU- funded project focused on the reuse of open data by start-ups and SMEs and on the translation and adoption of the Open Data Certificates in Italy.
