               Why this kind of data? And not other datasets? <a href="javascript:faqshow('#faq1')">< class="fa fa-arrow-circle-down fa-1x"></i></a>

                These data was used during the Big Data Challenge 2014, an online call for developers, researchers and designers from all over the world to come up with brand-new big data services and applications. The challenge was organized by Telecom Italia, in association with EIT ICT Labs, MIT Media Lab, Milan Polytechnic and Trento RISE.
                <br/>
                The data provided within the Dataset of the Big Data Challenge are geo-referenced and anonymous relating to the territories of Milan and of the Autonomous Province of Trento. The dataset contains millions of records of data covering the period from November to December 2013.<br/>
                The Big Data Challenge dataset contains data concerning telecommunications, energy, weather, public and private transport, social networks and events.

                <li>to create: to produce works from the database;</li>
                <li>to adapt: to modify, transform and build upon the database.</li>

                The ODbL also requires you to share any improvements you make to this databases under the ODbL as well.

                The ODbL requires you to attribute your use of this data. This is important as it allows us (and in turn the community) to benefit from reuse of our work, and so allows us to continue to provide this service. Use of any data must be accompanied by a hyperlink reading "from BigDataChallenge contest" and linking to either the ODI-Trento section homepage or the page referring to the information in question.

            Why the data is published on dandelion.eu? Do visitors of the site need a login?<a href="javascript:faqshow('#faq3')">< class="fa fa-arrow-circle-down fa-1x"></i></a>

            SpazioDati is one of the original technical partners of the “Big Data Challenge” contest. Its main role was to provide an affordable way to access to all the data related to the challenge and Dandelion is the original platform where all of this data was published.<br/>
            It’s not the first time that some large datasets are made available to the public, through a controlled access: we can cite the public data sets published on Amazon S3, for example.<br/>
            But it’s the first time that there is an official Open Data release starting from some Big Data sets: we know that it’s an hot topic.<br/>
            Using your account on dandelion.eu to access the data, let us to collect some useful insights on the real demand side of the Open Data value chain.<br/>
            We’ll publish these statistics of usage as Open Data, to make all the community involved more aware about the data value chain. 
            It’s also useful to give some real perceptions on the Smart Cities and Smart Communities visions.

            Why some datasets are published as raw data and others as APIs?<a href="javascript:faqshow('#faq4')">< class="fa fa-arrow-circle-down fa-1x"></i></a>
			</h4>
			<p class="text-muted" id="faq4"  style="visibility: hidden;">
            As you can see, the data was supplied in batch mode, using downloadable compressed files, or through API, if this kind of access is meaningful.<br/> 
            It depends from the nature itself of the data: the telephone grids or the data about time intervals

            Can I copy these data and publish on others websites? Or using torrent, and P2P sharing networks? <a href="javascript:faqshow('#faq5')">< class="fa fa-arrow-circle-down fa-1x"></i></a>
            </h4>
			<p class="text-muted" id="faq5"  style="visibility: hidden;">
            Yes, of course. You can do anything you want, as you remain under the ODbL license conditions.
